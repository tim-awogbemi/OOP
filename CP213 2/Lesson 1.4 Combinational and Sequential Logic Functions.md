###### List several types of logic functions
	- logic functions, such as comparison, arithmetic, code conversion, encoding, decoding, data selection, counting, and storage.

###### What does a comparator do?
	- A comparator compares two quantities and indicates whether or not they are equal.

###### What are the four basic arithmetic operations?
	-Addition: performed by an ADDER (adds two binary numbers and generates a sum (Σ) and a carry output (Cout))
	-Subrtaction: performed by an SUBTRACTER (requires 3 inputs... the two numbers being subtracted and a borrow input) ex input 8-5 with no borrow input the answer is 3 with no borrow input
	-Multiplication: Multiplication is performed by a logic circuit called a multiplier. Numbers are always multiplied two at a time, so two inputs are required.
	-Division: Two inputs to the divider are required, and the outputs generated are the quotient and the remainder.

###### Describe encoding and give an example.
	-Encoding is the transformation of one source of information ex. such as a decimal number or an alphabetic character into another coded form
	-Example: One example of encoding is when you convert a huge .WAV audio file to a tiny .MP3 file that you can easily send to a friend via email. The files are encoded in different formats but will play the same song.

###### Describe decoding and give an example.
	-Decoding converts coded information such as a a binary number into a noncoded form such as a decimal number
	-As an example, when sending an email, all data, including certain attachments and images, are encoded using a format such as Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME). When data arrives, decoding converts the email message content to its original form.

###### Explain the basic purpose of multiplexing and demultiplexing.
	-the basic purpose of multiplexing and demultiplexing is to combine information streams from multiple sources for the purpose of transmitting them over a shared medium**.
	- Refer to page 15 in the textbook diagram

###### Name four types of storage devices.
	-A flip-flop is a bistable (two stable states) logic circuit that can store only one bit at a time, either a 1 or a 0. The output of a flip-flop indicates which bit it is storing. A HIGH output indicates that a 1 is stored and a LOW output indicates that a 0 is stored.
	-Register: combination of several flip flops... registers can be used to shift the bits from one position to another within the register or out of the register to another circuit.... can be serial or parallel... Serial = loading a bus 1 by 1 vs parallel is simultaneous
	-Semiconductor memories are devices typically used for storing large numbers of bits. RAM VS ROM
	-Magnetic disk memories are used for mass storage of binary data. An example is a computer’s internal hard disk
	Optical memories: A laser beam is used to store the data on the disc and to read the data from the disc. ex cds blu ray

###### What does a counter do?
	-their basic purpose is to count events represented by changing levels or pulses. To count, the counter must “remember” the present number so that it can go to the next proper number in sequence.
