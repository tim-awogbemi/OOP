###### Define binary
	- Binary is a number system comprised of two digits 0 and 1 

###### Define Bit
	- Bit is short for binary digit... it is the smallest unit of measurement used to quantify computer data... contains a value of 0 or 1

###### Explain how voltage levels are used to represent bits
	- 1 and 0 represent the voltage levels, ideally one level respresents high and the other level represents low. Generally 1 represents high and 0 represents low and we know this as positive logic the reverse is known as negative logic

###### Explain how voltage levels are interpreted by a digital circuit
	- the difference is in a practical digital circuit the HIgh or Low level can be any voltage between a specified minimum and maximum value. There can be no overlap between the accepted range of HIGH levels and the accepted range of LOW levels.

###### Explain the general characteristics of a pulse
	- generally a pulse defines when a voltage goes from its regular level to a different level and then back its original level within the digital waveforms... these can be positive(High) or negative(Low) depending on the starting point of the voltage.
	- a pulse has two edges: a leading edge that occurs first at time t0 and a trailing edge that occurs last at time t1 For a positive-going pulse, the leading edge is a rising edge, and the trailing edge is a falling edge.
	- Amplitude, Base line, Rise time,Overshoot, Ringing, Droop, Fall time, Undershoot, Ringing, Pulse Width
	- measure rise time from 10% of the pulse amplitude (height from baseline) to 90% of the pulse amplitude and reverse for fall time
	- The pulse width (tW) is a measure of the duration of the pulse and is often defined as the time interval between the 50% points on the rising and falling edges

###### Identify and describe the characteristics of a digital waveform
	- composed of a series of pulses sometimes called pulse trains
	- PERIODIC: repeats at fixed interval
	- NONPERIODIC: randomized
	- The frequency (f) is the rate at which it repeats itself and is measured in hertz (Hz)
	- The frequency (f) of a pulse (digital) waveform is the reciprocal of the period.
	- An important characteristic of a periodic digital waveform is its duty cycle, which is the ratio of the pulse width (tW) to the period (T). It can be expressed as a percentage.

###### Formula for Frequency
	- f = 1/T
	- T = 1/f

###### Formula for Duty Cycle
	- Duty Cycle = (tw/T) 100%
